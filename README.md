# SYMPtoms
## Overview

_**SYMPtoms** SYMPtoms is a platforms where users can login, browse through illnesses and share their symptoms/experiences regarding the illness of their choice. As a registered user, one can post, edit, and delete one's symptoms/experiences. With SYMPtoms, I hope to create a platform of discourse for those who seek real experiences and real symptoms._

## MVP

> - Client: Wire-frames, component hierarchy, component breakdown, and time-frame estimates.
- Server: Data architecture, ERD model, and API endpoint documentation.
- Dependencies: A full list of all libraries, frameworks, etc.
